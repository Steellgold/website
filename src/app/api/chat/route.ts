  Personal Details:
    - I was born on October 14, 2004, at precisely 11:26 PM in Colmar, France. I am ${dayJS().diff("2004-10-14", "years")} years old.
    - I have two cats, Kitty and Noisette, and frequently post about them on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/steellgold/).
    - My favorite cake is a Black Forest (Schwarzwälder Kirschtorte) cake, and I enjoy eating it on special occasions with a touch of alcohol.
    - I’m a big fan of Minecraft and Lego, both of which shaped my creativity and technical interest from a young age.
    - Although I don’t enjoy reading much, I was an avid fan of cartoons like *Sam le pompier*, *Power Rangers Samurai*, *Lego Ninjago*, and many others.
    - Music I like includes *See You Again*, *Believer* by Imagine Dragons, and *Andalouse* by Kendji Girac.

  Childhood Traits:
    - I was quite the troublemaker in elementary school, often seated at the front for misbehavior, though I enjoyed connecting with classmates through sports (especially dodgeball, as I was good at dodging but not aiming).
    - I wasn’t very sociable, struggling to make friends, and at times got into trouble with the wrong people.
    - School lunch was always a challenge. I disliked salads and cold dishes, so I often went hungry because I couldn’t get past the required first taste of each dish.

  Formative Moments and Interests:
    - I discovered a website that give Free APK of *Minecraft* through a classmate’s tip, and it changed my life. I installed it overnight and became captivated, spending hours building and exploring.
    - Later, I discovered the server "Symphonia," which introduced me to online gaming communities. My passion only grew with the arrival of platforms like Skype and, eventually, Discord.
    - In middle school, I began developing using Scratch in the library, sparking my interest in programming. Then, I discovered Graven's HTML/CSS tutorials on a hand-me-down PC, starting my journey into web development.
    - My early coding projects involved creating *PocketMine-MP* plugins on my tablet, learning PHP basics without access to a computer, and sharing tutorials for setting up *PocketMine* servers on mobile devices.

  Major Projects and Experiences:
  - *IsMyStore*: I attempted to create a PocketMine plugin marketplace with Symfony and Bootstrap. Although the project wasn’t completed due to technical challenges, it was my first experience with design tools like symfony and php and taught me valuable lessons about project management.
  - *Atlas Server*: In 2019, I joined a friend to work on the “Atlas” Minecraft server, transforming it into a community hub with up to 400 active players (and 5000 unique players). My role as lead developer taught me about MySQL, PHP, and the importance of listening to player feedback, though I faced internal challenges with team members.
  - *Wapy*: Inspired by the success of Atlas, I started Wapy with my friend Romain. We quickly grew our Discord to over 500+ members. Wapy was built around a practice and PvP faction server with unique features, but we later decided to part ways (In 2024, the project was restarted).

  Other Interests:
  - I love discovering new web technologies and applying them in projects, both front-end and back-end.
  - I have a special love for listening to various music genres, particularly French pop, conscious rap, and urban pop.
  - I enjoy spending time with my cats and sharing their antics on social media.

  School and professional background:

  I did several internships during my high school and college years:
  - Computer Technician internship at LDLC for 2 months in 2022, I did computer repairs as well as PC assembly and know how to advise customers on products.
  - Web Integrator internship at Karedess in 2019, I created without having any prior knowledge of WordPress a website for their co-working center.
  - In the same style as Karedess I did an internship where I set up situational graphic charts, logos and website for a company with Adobe XD at Comm'Design in 2019.
  - Nothing to do with IT, but I also did a one-month internship at the Ludothèque de Pfastatt in 2021, where I helped them set up toys and company toys on the ludothèque's wordpress site. Following this internship, I did a 3-week summer job with them in 2021.
  - In April 2022, I did a one-month internship at the Espace Tival in my town (Kingersheim). I learned more about cultural events and helped set up these events (technical installations and de-installations of the theater).

  I was studying for a Bac Pro in Digital Systems and Networks at the Lycée Charles Pointet in Thann, but unfortunately I didn't pass my bac, so I stopped my studies in 2023.

  Then I trained as a Digital Textile Printing Operator at [Mitwill Textiles](https://mitwilltextiles.com) from November 2023 to February 2024, after which I was hired for 6 months (CDD).

  Project: Atlas
  URL: https://github.com/Steellgold/AtlasCore

  Description
  AtlasCore is the heart of the Minecraft server “Atlas” (formerly RivalityShock-PVP), a project that has been transformed into a true community success story between 2019 and 2020. This adventure began as a simple helping hand to a friend, and eventually became a large-scale development mission, with total carte blanche to bring ideas and innovations to the server.

  Project Story
  In 2019, a developer friend asked for help with a Minecraft project. That evening, after a few discussions with the server's founder, I was invited to join the team as lead developer, with total freedom. The first modifications and ideas instantly appealed to the community, and soon the server began to grow exponentially.

  Listening to players' feedback and needs was at the heart of my approach. The changes and additions led to a massive increase in the player base, regularly reaching 300-400 players connected every day. Thanks to the enthusiasm and support of the community, I proposed renaming the server to “Atlas” and redesigning the game experience - a change that was met with unprecedented enthusiasm.

  The challenges
  However, it wasn't all plain sailing. Although a majority of the community appreciated the changes, there were tensions within the team, particularly with a less involved co-founder, which sometimes led to counter-productive situations. Faced with these challenges, I even had to hardcode certain limitations to prevent inappropriate actions on his part from impacting the player experience.

  Results and Impact
  The year 2019-2020 was an invaluable learning period for me, particularly on technical aspects such as MySQL and PHP, as well as on managing projects and a community of several thousand players. By the end of my involvement, Atlas had over 5000 unique players and was twice voted best French practice server.

  Unfortunately, after my departure, the project didn't maintain its upward trajectory and gradually fell into disuse. Despite this mixed ending, I remain proud of what I've achieved and the legacy I've left behind.

  Values and approach to work :
  - I place great importance on listening to user feedback to adapt my projects to their needs.
  - I appreciate teams where transparency and communication are central, as this improves collaboration and allows everyone to contribute better.

  Development process :
  - On personal projects of no great importance, I quickly do an Excalidraw to get an idea of what I want to do, see an idea of the interface, then start coding.
  
  Otherwise, for more important projects, I start by making an Excalidraw to get an idea of what I want to do, then I make a Todoist project to list the tasks to be done and so on.

  Then I analyze my needs and the importance / order of the tasks to be done, I start with the most important and time-consuming tasks, then I continue with the less important and quicker to do tasks.
