      <p>â€¢ Linkfy is a link shortener that allows users to shorten links and share them with others.</p>
      <p className="mt-1">â€¢ It was my serious first open-source project, I learned how to use TypeScript with SvelteKit and how to deploy applications on Vercel.</p>
      <p className="mt-1">â€¢ It was on this project that I discovered Supabase, I learned how to use TailwindCSS and how to make REST APIs or use Prisma with PostgreSQL.</p>
      <p className="mt-1">â€¢ During the activity period of Linkfy, the site had more than <span className="text-yellow-100">~500 shortened links</span>.</p>
      
      <Separator className="mt-3" />

      <p className="mt-3">â€¢ Despite the failure of this project, I learned a lot of things, and the most important thing is that I have to secure my APIs, because I realized too late that anyone could use the API routes to modify the shortened links of anyone.</p>
